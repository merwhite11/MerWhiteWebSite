    <p class="p1 p15" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p9 c3" style=""> Bright mornings. Longer days, longer hours. Late afternoons thick with the heat of the
      sliding sun. The canopy full, leafy long vines, tilting, slanting, bowing over. The grapes squishy and sticky to
      the touch, tart and sweet to the taste. The leaves dry, snap off easy now. The sun splitting right down the middle
      of the sky. Full exposure, the radiant peak. </p>

    <p class="p9 c3" style="">June 4</p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Full body fatigue.</p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">After day of much heat. Lots of things ache and sore, right ankle, left bicep. I want to
      feel whole and durable and alive like yesterday. </p>

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Shoot tucking</p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Vines, when left to their own devices are nasty, snarling tendrilled things, that cling
      onto anything in their midst. Where there were once neat little rows of pink and green sprouts in Spring, there
      now is a chaotic jungle of vines spilling out over the corset of their trellis. </p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Here, the humble shoot-tucker places themself, beneath the arched canopy
        of the bowing vines, not unlike a surfer in the curl of an endlessly cresting green wave. The nice thing is that
        it is shady beneath the canopy. The not nice thing is that you</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
        class="c1 c4">re looking up all day and your neck starts to hurt and your hat is useless. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The job is to tuck each vine into the wire. Some vineyard tasks, when
        taken out of the context of labor, sound ridiculous. Look at this massive sea of tangled, slanted, falling,
        twisted vines, he can</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t possibly mean </span><span
        class="c1 c8">every </span><span class="c1 c4">vine? But then consider we have a crew of 6-8 people and 10 hours
        to do it. We have water and food and a 30-minute lunch break and two 15-minute breaks. We have music to listen
        to, our minds to let wander, and our coworkers to talk to when we come across something interesting, like a
        thought, a bird</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s nest with featherless baby birds tucked
        in it, a question, a baby bunny to catch, pass around, hold, let go. We have only one responsibility for the day
        and it is to tuck in the vines. Every last one. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The shoot-tuckers are loaded with pocketfuls of plastic clips that can be
        snapped onto the trellis wire to keep the shoot upright, but per the entropic tendencies of this universe, the
        vines have a way of slipping back out from under the wire, despite the clips</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4"> best efforts. </span></p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Don</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t force, be
        nice, be gentle, be calm. When something hurts, be easy. Breath, relax, know that you will not pee your pants.
        Must believe I am strengthening. Evelyn came today. Freaked out a bit, comparing myself to something I am not.
        She said, </span><span class="c1 c8">how old do you think I am?</span><span class="c1 c4"> She was on her knees,
        I was looking at her through my row of vines. Removing the bottom two leaves from every shoot. I said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">about my age</span><span class="c1 c4">, even though I thought she was a little older
        because she said something about taking care of a family, so I thought she maybe had kids. She was wearing a
        black hoodie with the hood up over her blue baseball hat and a tan bandanna over her face and tight jeans tucked
        into leather boots. She said, </span><span class="c1 c8">how old are you?</span><span class="c1 c4"> and I said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">27</span><span class="c1 c4">. Too old to be doing this, I suddenly feel. She said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">me ganas por 7</span><span class="c1 c4">. She is only 20. Her dad died when she was
        17, and she came here to work. First she was in Salinas with her aunt. Now she</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s here with her brother. </span></p>
