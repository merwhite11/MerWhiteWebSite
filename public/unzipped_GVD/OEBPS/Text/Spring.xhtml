    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c3">A time of great upheaval. Out of the dark knobby wood, up they come, out
        they sprout. Pushing through the air, shoving out little beginnings, fuzzy and white like cotton, and up they
        climb, shoving ever upward. Buds, folded in on themselves, then unfolding, pink and green, like mini heads of
        cabbage, fanning out, one layer at a time. Time to cut, mow. There is the sound of machinery grinding all
        around</span><span class="c1 c3">—</span><span class="c1 c3">mower, gramegna, weedwacker, woodchipper.
        Mobilization of people, movement. Up. Up. Breezey and sunny with shapely clouds. The sun filtering through the
        now the fully flushed leaves, soft and juicy with life, absorbent and thick. </span></p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">A very wet day. Painting with Don Lupe. Poppies and lupins and the
        mustard maturing into elegant pastels. Purple pea blossoms too, open and closed </span><span
        class="c1 c4">–</span><span class="c1 c4"> like a head in a bonnet. Picking them, eating them, taste same as a
        pea. Sprinkling lightly, everything felt far away, distant like behind a screen. Painting pruning cuts with Don
        Lupe. He kept asking me what time it was because I have a watch and he didn</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t want to check his phone. </span></p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">I thought sad, melancholy for definite arrival of spring </span><span
        class="c1 c4">– </span><span class="c1 c4">now with budbreak under my fingertips </span><span class="c1 c4">–
      </span><span class="c1 c4">sorry for all the days I wished it to hurry up and come because now winter is gone
        gone; intimate winter, like a secret we shared. Squirming, chirping, convulsing baby moles in steaming compost
        heap. </span></p>
