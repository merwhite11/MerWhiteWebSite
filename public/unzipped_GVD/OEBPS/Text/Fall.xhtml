  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c3">This season of readiness. The vines draining their life into the grapes.
      Draining, so that they stiffen into a rigid, brittle scaffolding, draining so that the grape skins soften and
      blacken, draining so that the grape juice sweetens. This season of palpable ripeness. Grapes hanging heavy on
      the branch. It starts slow, the champagne grapes, the sauvignon blanc, the chardonnay, the trucks driving up and
      down the valley loaded with bins of grapes. Then it</span><span class="c1 c3">’</span><span class="c1 c3">s the
      pinot noir, the merlot, the malbec, the syrah, the grenache, we</span><span class="c1 c3">’</span><span
      class="c1 c3">re getting into the swing of it. Then comes the petit verdot, the cabernet franc, the trucks are
      caravanning now. Last is the cabernet sauvignon.</span></p>

  <p class="p10 c4" style="">The pick, the harvest</p>
  <p class="p9 c3" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">There is a big relief because we know the hardest of the season is behind us. There is
    much excitement and hubbahubba for the first harvest. We get headlamps and bins and a partner. 2 pickers per row.

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">We get there and it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
      class="c1 c4">s still hot from the day. The sun sets. I notice only when I come out of the row and
      it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s all pink and red and so beautiful I want to take a
      picture or cry, but then Agust</span><span class="c1 c4">í</span><span class="c1 c4">n is yelling </span><span
      class="c1 c8">YA</span><span class="c1 c4"> and the tractor is towing away the two macrobins (1 ton of grapes
      total) that we have just filled and the new tractor driven by Gutierrez is chugging down the middle of the next
      set of 8 rows, towing 2 empty macrobins for us to fill. Luis is counting the rows so we know which
      pair</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s turn it is to be closest to the tractor and which
      pair has to be on the outside, farthest from the tractor. Each position has its pros and cons, which is why we
      rotate. </span></p>

      and come into a calm flat world where nothing matters much. The last quarter of a basketball game used to carry
      him into this world; you ran not as the crowd thought for the sake of the score but for yourself, in a kind of
      idleness. There was you and sometimes the ball and then the hole, the high perfect hole with its pretty skirt of
      net. It was you, just you and that fringed ring</span><span class="c1 c4">…”</span></p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><br /><span class="c1 c4">That is harvest. You reach a wall. Then, you push beyond. There is
      me, my scissors, my bandeja, and the stems, tough and sinewy like an umbilical cord. It is the stems you want to
      focus your eyes on, direct your scissors toward. Then there</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span

      chance to empty, get a few more clusters in there, ok, do it now before the tractor pulls ahead, lift up the
      heavy thing, up and over your head, lean into the trellis wire, with your thumbs now flip the crate over, empty
      it onto the heap, run back to your spot, kick the bandeja, now light and squirley at your feet. </span></p>
