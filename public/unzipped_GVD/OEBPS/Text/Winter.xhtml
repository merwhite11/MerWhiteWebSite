    <span class="c1 c3">In the winter time, the vines are sticky things, bare and brown.
      Everything is see-through. The vines are just their wooden skeleton. You can see them as individual
      entities</span><span class="c1 c3">—</span><span class="c1 c3">trunk, two arms, repeat. It is cold and people
      feel close to you. The vineyard feels small; like if you took the time, you could feasibly count every vine and
      see that it is only a matter of multiplying 100 rows by 96 vines per row. You can see that it is not a massive,
      impossible sea. You can see that it is just a big thing made up of many small components. </span> </p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Today fantastically windy, like a movie. We could hardly walk straight.
        Whipping winds, relentlessly gusting. Like waves crashing. Lucino wore his sunglasses which he never does when

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">When I realized I could get paid to learn Spanish, spend all day outside,
        not have to deal with finicky vineyard technology equipment (as I had in my previous job) and get off work no
        later than 4 pm</span><span class="c1 c4">—</span><span class="c1 c4">I felt like I had hacked the system. Why

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">I figured that if someone who had just crossed the border into this country could get
      hired as a vineyard worker without speaking a word of English, or having set foot in a vineyard, then I could too.</p>
